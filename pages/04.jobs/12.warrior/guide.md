      <blockquote>
          <p>On the northernmost edge of Abalathia's Spine exists a mountain tribe renowned for producing fearsome mercenaries. Wielding greataxes and known as warriors, these men and women learn to harness their inner-beasts and translate that power to unbridled savagery on the battlefield.</p>
          <p>In former times which saw war waged ceaselessly in Eorzea, the warriors featured prominently on the frontlines of battle. With the arrival of peacetime, however, their art has descended into the shadows of obscurity, where it remains to this day.</p>

## Play Style

Warrior is a tanking job that is well known for their high damage that it can output but out of all the tanking classes has the least damage mitigation abilities. Usually taking the roll of off-tanking warriors are seen as an easy-to-learn job, but growing in difficulty as they level and players try to min/max them.

## How to become a Warrior
The job requires you to have a level 30 [Marauder](http://fellcleave.com/classes/marauder) and the [Sylph-management](http://xivdb.com/quest/66049/sylph-management) main scenario quest completed. The main scenario quest can be accepted from Minfilia in **The Walking Sands (x6,y6)**. Once you have the 2 required steps completed, you can accept [Pride And Duty (Will Take You From The Mountain)](http://xivdb.com/quest/66585/pride+and+duty+(will+take+you+from+the+mountain)) from **Wyrnzoen in Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks (x11,y6)** quest which will unlock the Warrior job.
