      <blockquote>
          <p>The pious Ishgardian clergy guide the flock, and the devout knights protect the weak. Yet even the holiest of men succumb to the darkest of temptations.</p>
          <p>None dare to administer justice to these sacrosanct elite residing outside the reach of the law. Who, then, defends the feeble from the transgressions of those meant to guide and protect them?</p>
          <p>A valiant few take up arms to defend the downtrodden, and not even the holy priests and knights can escape their judgment. Pariahs in their own land, they are known by many as “dark knights.”</p>
          <p>These sentinels bear no shields declaring their allegiance. Instead, their greatswords act as beacons to guide the meek through darkness.</p>

## Play Style

Dark Knight is a job specialized in tanking and dealing damage with the help of their specific stances. With the help of [Dark Arts](http://xivdb.com/action/3635/dark+arts), an action specific for the job, Dark Knights can greatly increase the next offensive or defensive action used. Can be MP starving if actions are performed without proper management of the resource.

## How to become a Dark Knight
The job starts from level 30, does not require a base class but requires Heavensward. The starting quests for this class is [Our End](http://xivdb.com/quest/67589/our+end) which can be taken from **Ishgardian Citizen** that can be found in **The Pillars x13,y9** (Ishgard)

      The Blood Gauge displays the amount of Blackblood a dark knight has accumulated. Blackblood is accumulated by several different means, including through the execution of select weaponskills.

Blackblood can be consumed to execute actions such as Delirium (acquired at level 62) and Bloodspiller (acquired at level 68).
