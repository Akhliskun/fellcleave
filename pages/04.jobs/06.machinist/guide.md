      <blockquote>
          <p>The war with Dravania rages on, brutal and unrelenting. With no end in sight, the Holy See grows desperate. As her dragoons lay down their lives in defense of their home, Ishgard turns to technology to protect her sons and daughters. Great cannons and ballistas now line the city walls, plucking dragons from the sky.</p>
          <p>Following the example of Cid Garlond, who has demonstrated the potency of magitek, the Skysteel Manufactory works tirelessly on the development of advanced armaments. As new and devastating weapons are brought to the fray, a new class of champion arises to wield them―the machinist.</p>

## Play Style

Machinists are a very mobile job and with the changes that got introduced in 4.0, their mobility only got better. Using turrents to cause damage and provide buffs they have fantastic utility.

## How to become a Machinist
The job starts from level 30, does not require a base class but requires **Heavensward**. The starting quests for this class is [Savior of Skysteel](http://xivdb.com/quest/67232/savior+of+skysteel) which can be taken from [Stephanivien](http://xivdb.com/npc/1012222/jannequinard) that can be found in **Foundation x8,y10** (Ishgard)

      The Ammunition Gauge indicates the number of rounds of special ammunition currently loaded in a machinist's firearm. Special ammunition can be loaded to any firearm by executing the action Reload.

   <div class="col-md-5">
      When the gauge reaches 100, the firearm becomes overheated. While overheated, a firearm will deal additional damage, but will soon become too hot to use. At this time, the Gauss Barrel is automatically removed and cannot be reattached until it cools.
