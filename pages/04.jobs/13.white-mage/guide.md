## Lore

      <blockquote>
          <p>White magic, the arcane art of succor, was conceived eras past that the world might know comfort. Alas, man began perverting its powers for self-gain, and by his wickedness brought about the Sixth Umbral catastrophe. Although the art subsequently became forbidden, it is now in the midst of a revival at the hands of the Padjal, chosen of the elementals.</p>
          <p>Those who would walk the path of the white mage are healers without peer, possessed of the power to deliver comrades from the direst of afflictionsâ€”even the icy grip of death itself.</p>

## Play Style

White Mage is a healing job that has the highest healing thruput from the game. With the help of HP regen skills, a HP heal, and occasional DPS bursts, white mages are a very varied healing job.

## How to become a White Mage
The job requires you to have a level 30 [Conjurer](http://fellcleave.com/classes/conjurer) and the [Sylph-management](http://xivdb.com/quest/66049/sylph-management) main scenario quest completed. The main scenario quest can be accepted from Minfilia in **The Walking Sands (x6,y6)**. Once you have the 2 required steps completed, you can accept [Seer Folly](http://xivdb.com/quest/66615/seer+folly) accepted from **E-Sumi-Yan in Old Gridania (x6,y10)** quest which will unlocks the White Mage job.

   <div class="col-md-5">
     The Healing Gauge displays the current number of Lilies a white mage has accumulated. Lilies are sometimes accumulated when casting Cure or Cure II on a wounded party member engaged in combat.

Lilies reduce recast times for certain actions by a percentage corresponding to the number stacked in the Healing Gauge. Lilies can also be consumed to execute the action Divine Benison (acquired at level 66).
