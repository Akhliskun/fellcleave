      <blockquote>
          <p>On the eastern edge of Abalathia's Spine lies the mountainous region of Gyr Abania.</p>
          <p>It is in these elevated lands that people took shelter, when a burning star guided them away from the Sixth Umbral Calamity's treacherous floodwaters. The survivors gathered from near and far, and amongst them were refugees of the sorcerous cities of Mhach and Amdapor.</p>
          <p>These sworn enemies buried their history for the sake of the future, and cast aside their vestments of black and white. Upon the remnants of their arts a new discipline was built, and the first red mages stepped forward with rapiers in hand to fight back against the rising tides of destruction.</p>

## Play Style

The **Red Mage** is a hybrid ranged and melee DPS job. 
<br />

## How to become a Red Mage
The job requires you to have a **level 50 job** and the StormBlood expansion. You can accept [Taking the Red](http://xivdb.com/quest/68112/taking+the+red) from Distraught Lass in Ul'dah. Once you complete the quest chain Red Mage will be unlocked.

## Job Gauge

<br />
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
      The Balance Gauge displays the current amount of black mana and white mana a red mage has accumulated. Black mana is accumulated by casting spells commonly associated with black magic (such as Fire or Thunder), and white mana by casting spells associated with white magic (such as Aero). There are also some spells and actions that affect both.

  </div>
   <div class="col-md-5">
      When both black and white mana reach a certain amount, the weaponskills Riposte, Zwerchhau, and Redoublement become enchanted and will deal additional damage. If the gap between black and white mana accumulation grows too large, the crystal at the top of the gauge will change color, and it will become more difficult to accumulate the lesser of the two.
