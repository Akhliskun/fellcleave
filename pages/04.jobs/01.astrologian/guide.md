## Lore
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
      <blockquote>
          <p>Ever has man coveted knowledge, and none more so than that of his fate. Thus did he labor to master the skill of foresight—but initial efforts bore little fruit. That is, until he looked to the stars above, which foretell the coming seasons, and learned to read the heavens.</p>
          <p>Though this gift is known today as astrology, the people of Sharlayan saw fit to not only read the stars, but to write their movements as well. By attuning their aetherial energies to that of constellations, they learned to wield magicks with heretofore unseen properties.</p>
          <p>Thus was astromancy born—a new form of magick which grants its users power over fate. Employing a star globe and divining deck in their miraculous deeds, fortune always smiles upon these masters of arcana.</p>

## Play Style

The Astrologian is a healing job that was introduced in Final Fantasy 14 Heavensward that uses Star Globe as it's main weapon and employs celestial magicks along with a divining deck in order to heal and support their parties.

Astrologians draws cards randomly, which can be used to give party members one of six buffs. These buffs can also be enhanced in potency or duration, or made to cover an area of effect in exchange for potency. Mastering these effects is a key skill in making the most of your abilities.

## How to become an Astrologian
The job starts from level 30, does not require a base class but requires **Heavensward**. The starting quests for this class is [Stairway to the Heavens](http://xivdb.com/quest/67548/stairway+to+the+heavens) which can be taken from [Jannequinard](http://xivdb.com/npc/1012222/jannequinard) that can be found in **The Pillars x15,y10** (Ishgard)
