## Lore

      <blockquote>
          <p>The beast tribes of Eorzea worship and summon forth beings known as primals, among which are Ifrit, Garuda, and Titan. Yet what is a god to one man is a demon to another, for the city-states of Eorzea see these beings as a grave threat to their collective survival.</p>
          <p>In times immemorial, there lived mages who had not only the power to summon the primals, but also the means to transmute the primals' essences, thus binding them to their will. Known simply as summoners, the existence of these men and women and their arcane art have been all but lost to the ages.</p>

## Play Style

The **Summoner** is a ranged casting DPS job that specializes in summoning Ifrit, Garuda and Titan as their Primal-Egis (pets). Maintaining all the abilities from Arcanists, they have a suit of tools to deal with their foes in the most efficient way. 
<br />

## How to become an Summoner
The job requires you to have a **level 30 Arcanist** the [Sylph-management](http://xivdb.com/quest/66049/sylph-management) main scenario quest and the [Sinking Doesmaga](http://xivdb.com/quest/65997/sinking+doesmaga) class quest completed. The main scenario quest can be accepted from Minfilia in **The Walking Sands (x6,y6)** and the class quest can be accepted from Thubyrgeim in **Limsa Lominsa Lower Decks (x4,y11)**. Once you have the 3 required steps completed, you can accept [Austerities of Flame](http://xivdb.com/quest/66627/austerities+of+flame) which will unlock the Summoner job.

      The Aetherflow Gauge also displays a summoner's current level of Aethertrail Attunement. A full gauge indicates the action Dreadwyrm Trance is ready for execution. When Dreadwyrm Trance is executed, the Trance Gauge is also displayed indicating time remaining in the current trance

  <div class="col-md-5">
     The Trance Gauge also indicates the current level of Dreadwyrm Aether accumulated by a summoner. A single unit of Dreadwyrm Aether is accumulated each time a Dreadwyrm Trance ends. When 2 or more units of Dreadwyrm Aether have been accumulated, the action Summon Bahamut (acquired at level 70) will become available for execution. Once Demi-Bahamut has been summoned, the gauge will indicate how much time remains before he must return.
