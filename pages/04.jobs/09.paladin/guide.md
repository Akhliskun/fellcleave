      <blockquote>
          <p>For centuries, the elite of the Sultansworn have served as personal bodyguards to the royal family of Ul'dah. Known as paladins, these men and women marry exquisite swordplay with stalwart shieldwork to create a style of combat uncompromising in its defense. Clad in brilliant silver armor, they charge fearlessly into battle, ever ready to lay down their lives for their liege.</p>
          <p>To be a paladin is to protect, and those who choose to walk this path will become the iron foundation upon which the party's defense is built.</p>

## Play Style

Using Swords and Shields, Paladins are a tanking job that is well known for their versatility to deal with all types of damage mitigation. Compared to the other tanks, Paladins have the lowest damage but the biggest toolkit of damage migitation abilities and for really tight situations they can even go immune.

## How to become a Paladin
The job requires you to have a level 30 [Gladiator](http://fellcleave.com/classes/gladiator), the [Sylph-management](http://xivdb.com/quest/66049/sylph-management) main scenario quest and [The Rematch](http://xivdb.com/quest/65801/the+rematch) gladiator quest completed. The main scenario quest can be accepted from Minfilia in **The Walking Sands (x6,y6)** and the gladiator quests can be accepted from **Mylla in Ul'dah - Steps of Thal (x9,y12)**. Once you have the 3 required steps completed, you can accept [Paladin's Pledge](http://xivdb.com/quest/66591/paladin's+pledge) from **Lulutsu in Ul'dah - Steps of Thal (x9,y12)** quest which will unlock the Paladin job.
