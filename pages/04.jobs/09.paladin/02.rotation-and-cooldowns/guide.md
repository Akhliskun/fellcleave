## Recommended Role Skills
If you are interested in the **best role skills for Paladins**, especially for raiding, we recommend the following setup: 

1. [Provoke](http://xivdb.com/action/7533/provoke)
2. [Shirk](http://xivdb.com/action/7537/shirk)
3. [Rampart](http://xivdb.com/action/7531/rampart)
4. [Reprisal](http://xivdb.com/action/7535/reprisal)
5. and [Convalescence](http://xivdb.com/action/7532/convalescence) 

This setup aim is to either help you build aggro really fast, better mitigate incoming damage or to empower your selfhealing. <br />
[Provoke](http://xivdb.com/action/7533/provoke) and [Rampart](http://xivdb.com/action/7531/rampart) for now are considered two mandatory role skills that every PLD should have in it's arsenal with [Shirk](http://xivdb.com/action/7537/shirk) being very valuable for this job as it reduces the number of enmity combos needed to be performed for a successful tank swap.

For dungeons you can replace [Provoke](http://xivdb.com/action/7533/provoke) with [Ultimatum](http://xivdb.com/action/7539/ultimatum) which will AoE taunt the enemies around you.

We will be keeping an eye and update this section as new information is available.

## Paladin Opener Rotation
### Main-Tanking
The Paladin main-tanking opening rotation goal is to establish you on the aggro list and make sure the boss will not change targets by dumping magic damage onto the boss then work your way up to 100 Oath gauge. Once the opener is finished you should be in a comfortable position in which you can adapt to your current encounter/group requirements. 

1. [Holy Spirit](http://xivdb.com/action/8752/holy+spirit)
2. [Shield Lob](http://xivdb.com/action/24/shield+lob)
3. [Circle of Scorn](http://xivdb.com/action/23/circle+of+scorn)
4. [Fast Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8746/fast+blade) -> [Savage Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8747/savage+blade) -> [Rage of Halone](http://xivdb.com/action/8748/rage+of+halone) combo into [Spirits Within](http://xivdb.com/action/29/spirits+within)
5. [Fast Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8746/fast+blade) -> [Savage Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8747/savage+blade) -> [Rage of Halone](http://xivdb.com/action/8748/rage+of+halone) combo into [Requiescat](http://xivdb.com/action/8754/requiescat)
6. [Holy Spirit](http://xivdb.com/action/8752/holy+spirit) 5 times or till you don't have MP.


<br /> <hr />


### Off-Tanking
The off-tank rotation priority is to have your [Goring Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/3538/goring+blade) buffed and used 2 times during the [Fight or Flight](http://xivdb.com/action/20/fight+or+flight) duration but also cast [Requiescat](http://xivdb.com/action/8754/requiescat) during the last 3-2 seconds of the [Fight or Flight](http://xivdb.com/action/20/fight+or+flight) buff and then end up the opening rotation with 5 casts of [Holy Spirit](http://xivdb.com/action/8752/holy+spirit). This rotation is to ensure that you maximize the amount of damage you can do while taking low to no damage.

1. [Shirk](http://xivdb.com/action/7537/shirk) the Main-Tank, if you took this role skill.
2. [Fast Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8746/fast+blade)
2. [Riot Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8749/riot+blade)
3. [Fight or Flight](http://xivdb.com/action/20/fight+or+flight)
4. [Goring Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/3538/goring+blade)
5. [Circle of Scorn](http://xivdb.com/action/23/circle+of+scorn)
6. [Fast Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8746/fast+blade) -> [Riot Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8749/riot+blade) -> [Spirits Within](http://xivdb.com/action/29/spirits+within) into [Royal Authority](http://xivdb.com/action/8750/royal+authority)
7. [Fast Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8746/fast+blade) -> [Riot Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8749/riot+blade) into [Royal Authority](http://xivdb.com/action/8750/royal+authority)
8. [Fast Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8746/fast+blade) -> [Riot Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8749/riot+blade) -> [Goring Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/3538/goring+blade)
9. [Requiescat](http://xivdb.com/action/8754/requiescat)
10. [Holy Spirit](http://xivdb.com/action/8752/holy+spirit) 5 times or till you don't have MP.

### Single Target DPS Rotation
Once you have done your opener follow up with this rotation for the remaining of the encounter.

2. [Circle of Scorn](http://xivdb.com/action/23/circle+of+scorn) if available
3. [Riot Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/8749/riot+blade)
4. [Sword Oath](http://xivdb.com/action/26/sword+oath) + [Fight or Flight](http://xivdb.com/action/20/fight+or+flight) if available and if the damage intake allows you or if you are Off-Tanking
5. [Goring Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/3538/goring+blade)

## Multiple Target DPS
Guide still in development. Information will be added in the following days.


<br /> <hr />


<div id='cooldown-usage'></div>
## Cooldown Usage
[Fight or Flight](http://xivdb.com/action/20/fight+or+flight): should always be used during periods when you can output as much damage as possible. Always to use it before your highest hitting abilities and most importantly before [Goring Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/3538/goring+blade) and you will empower the potency of the dot being applied on the terget. If you are off-tanking you should use Sword Oath before Fight or Flight and any other combos that you want to follow up with.

[Sentinel](http://xivdb.com/action/17/sentinel): Is a defensive cooldown that reduces 40% of the damage you will take in the next 10 seconds. This cooldown should always be used before a high damage cast is about to hit you. You can also combo it with Invervention as explained below.

[Intervention](http://xivdb.com/action/7382/intervention): While Off-Tanking this ability is crazy good as it can be casted on the other tank, who fills the main-tank role, to help him better mitigate the incoming damage. While an utility skill, it can be considered an cooldown at the same time. Always try to look out for boss mechanics that come with high-damage and try to help out when possible! This ability can also come-in handy when there is a mechanic that lets say will hit for half or more  of someoneâ€™s HP using Intervention will smooth out the damage spike on the player and at the same time help out the healers who might be busy with healing the group up. All around this ability is an incredible utility that should be used as much as possible. You should always aim to use this ability if you have [Rampart](http://xivdb.com/action/7531/rampart) or [Sentinel](http://xivdb.com/action/17/sentinel) active for an added 50% damage reduction.
As an added TIP, [Intervention](http://xivdb.com/action/7382/intervention) is off the GCD which means that you can use it and follow with stance swap right away without losing your guage resources!

[Tempered Will](http://xivdb.com/action/19/tempered+will): Is a situational cooldown that will remove Blinds or Heavy (slow-downs) effects from you. This ability shiens when your encounter requires you to move from point A to B be as fast as possible but the Boss (or Adds) apply slow-down effects on you. While usage is limited don't look down on it as it can save you from a lot of problems when properly used.

[Bulwark](http://xivdb.com/action/22/bulwark): Really useful when tanking packs of adds and/or taking damage from multiple sources. If you and/or your healers strugle to keep you alive during adds tanking this cooldown should come-in really handy.

[Hallowed Ground](http://xivdb.com/action/8755/hallowed+ground): If no other cooldowns are available or you are about to take a hit that will kill you regadless of which CDs you have available, Hallowed Grounds should be your go-to ability. Because of the very high cooldown, 420 seconds, we recommend you to use this abilit with care and/or planning as it can be used to skip/ignore an encounter mechanic! 

[Divine Veil](http://xivdb.com/action/3540/divine+veil): A strong self-healing and group healing cooldown that interact really with with Convalescence and Clemency. You should take advantage of this ability during extended AoE damage on the group or when the encounter forces your party to be stacked. 

[Passage of Arms](http://xivdb.com/action/7385/passage+of+arms): One of the strongest cooldowns paladins have in their toolkit. A cone that starts from the location of your character and grows larger backwards/behind you. This ability makes your block rate 100% and every member that is in the protection area (skill effect) will take 15% less damage, including magic damage, for **18 seconds**! 
This is an incredible cooldown that should be used if your party is struggling during a high aoe damage phase and if group stacking is possible or not restricted by any mechanic the encounter might have. Keep in mind, if you move or use another action the ability will be cancelled.

<div id='core-concepts'></div>
## Core Concepts
This section will add a few extra notes for aspiring Paladins that wish to better support their group regadless of if hes a main or off tank. Learn how to combine cooldowns and how you can use them in efficient way to make encounters easier. 

[Divine Magic Mastery](http://xivdb.com/action/50411/divine+magic+mastery): Introduced in 4.0 this trait is an incredible asset that is available for Paladins as its reduces the MP cost of all spells by 50% and **most importantly it prevents interrupts if you are attacked**! This trait makes **Holy Spirit** and **Clemency** very strong even when you are main-tanking or during high damage phases. Read below for move information on those two abilities.

[Clemency](http://xivdb.com/action/8753/clemency): This ability is very strong and with the short cast time you can use it in situations that require some extra self-healing or group healing. 
Try to always us it just after you take a large hit as healers might not have the time to adapt to the large hit you just took. A good rule of thumb is, if the boss is casting a high hitting spell on you and the cast time of that spell is 2 seconds for example, you should **pre-cast** clemency when the boss ability has 1 second left or less. This way you will heal yourself right after the hit and surive the next melee. Pre-Casting Clemency, even if being hit by adds, is now possible because of **Divine Magic Mastery** that was explained above.

[Divine Veil](http://xivdb.com/action/3540/divine+veil): Probably one of the most interesting cooldowns in PLD toolkit. Using this ability at the correct time can save you from a wipe or help healers conserv their mana for later use. So how should you use this cooldown efectively? As we see if there are two main uses that you can pull off, both of them netting you a sweet AoE shield on your party. 

**Use 1**: During a high damage phase on a encounter and especially if you have taken Convalescence as one of your Role Skills you can: [Convalescence](http://xivdb.com/action/7532/convalescence) -> [Divine Veil](http://xivdb.com/action/3540/divine+veil) -> [Clemency](http://xivdb.com/action/8753/clemency). This combo aim is to get your Clemency as buffed as possible and then apply a shield on all your Melee around you that will make them take 10% less damage.

**Use 2**: During a stacking phase where all your group members are in a location you can pull of the same combo listed above to effectively shield all your group. As an example, this combo shines during/at the end of Susano's intermission (huge sword phase).


[Passage of Arms](http://xivdb.com/action/7385/passage+of+arms): Is an ability that should be used when stacking up is possible. While the effects of this skill are incredible we would like to stress the fact that you shouldn't move or cast any other ability as Passage of Arms **will be interrupted**! Always possition yourself a few steps infront of the stack as this will ensure that your group sits inside the active area of the ability. Keep in mind that this skill also works on magic damage and should always be used to skip mechanics that otherwise could wipe a group.
