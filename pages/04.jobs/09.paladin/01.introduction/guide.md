## Job Overview

Paladin is one of the tanking jobs in Final Fantasy 14: Stormblood which received a lot of changes that makes the class be more viable in content that is heavy on magic damage but also have a better synergy when playing together with a Dark Knight, for example, in a raiding environment. Paladin’s mobility while weak in 3.X got a great boost with the introduction of the new Sprint ability that doesn’t have a TP cost added to it anymore so Paladins can regen TP between pulls. 

Compared to the 3 tanking classes in 3.X Paladins were the lowest DPS tank and couldn’t mitigate the magic damage but this isn’t the case anymore! 

And last but not least, Paladins have a big toolkit of cooldowns and utility that they can bring to a group which puts them in a very favorable spot. If you considered trying out this job, there was never a better time than now!

## What Has Changed in 4.0?

* Paladins now have [Reprisal](http://xivdb.com/action/7535/reprisal) thanks of the new Role Skills introduced in Stormblood which can also be used together with [Divine Veil](http://xivdb.com/action/3540/divine+veil) to further assist the raid.
* TP deficiency got addressed and now are not an issue anymore.
* Enmity at lower levels was also addressed with the help of [Shield Oath](http://xivdb.com/action/28/shield+oath) which now requires only level 30.
* Damage output got a much needed buff with the help of [Sword Oath](http://xivdb.com/action/26/sword+oath) + [Fight or Flight](http://xivdb.com/action/20/fight+or+flight) and the new [Fast Blade](http://xivdb.com/action/9/fast+blade) combo.
* AoE tanking/aggro got better with [Total Eclipse](http://xivdb.com/action/7381/total+eclipse), Paladins are no longer required to spam [Flash](http://xivdb.com/action/14/flash) to keep aggro on multiple targets.
* Combo chains got a much needed change making Paladins more viable.
* A lot of casts, such as [Clemency](http://xivdb.com/action/8753/clemency), are non-interruptible anymore because of [Divine Magic Mastery](http://xivdb.com/action/50411/divine+magic+mastery).

## Strenghts

* Great for Off-Tanking and Main-Tanking. 
* Great toolkit to choose from to output crazy amounts of DPS when needed or when Off-Tanking
* Can mitigate damage for a party member using [Intervention](http://xivdb.com/action/7382/intervention).
* Access to [Sheltron](http://xivdb.com/action/3542/sheltron) which blocks the next attack **now including magic damage**!
* Brings lots of utility to any type of group size!

<div id='weaknesses'></div>
## Weaknesses

* Some abilities, such as [Sword Oath](http://xivdb.com/action/26/sword+oath), are on GCD which could introduce awkward moments when trying to change stances.
* Long damage mitigation cooldowns.

<div id='viability-in-current-patch'></div>
## Viability in Current Patch

With the introduction of the new combo chains, more aoe skills, damage throughput buff but also magic damage mitigation Paladins are in a really good position. Taking every change introduced by Stormblood, Paladins have a big chances to become on of the best, if not the best tanking job! 

We will be keeping an eye on how things evolve in the coming weeks and update this section as needed.
