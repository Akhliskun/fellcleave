## Lore

      <blockquote>
          <p>Though now under Garlean rule, the city-state of Ala Mhigo once boasted the greatest military might of all Eorzea. Among its standing armies were the monks—ascetic warriors as dreaded by foes on the field of battle as the city-state's great pikemen.</p>
          <p>The monks comprised an order known as the Fist of Rhalgr, and it was to this god—the Destroyer—that they devoted their lives of worship. By mastering seats of power within the body known as chakra, they are capable of performing extraordinary physical feats.</p>

## Play Style

Monks are very agile job, but dependant on possitioning as many of their attacks deal more damage at certain positions on top of that some actions can trigger certain effects depending on position. The main aim of monks is to keep up Grease Lightning buff to deal impressive sustained single-target damage.

## How to become a Monk
The job requires you to have a level 30 [Pugilist](http://fellcleave.com/classes/pugilist) and the [Sylph-management](http://xivdb.com/quest/66049/sylph-management) main scenario quest completed. The main scenario quest can be accepted from Minfilia in **The Walking Sands (x6,y6)**. Once you have the 2 required steps completed, you can accept [Brother From Another Mother](http://xivdb.com/quest/66597/brother+from+another+mother) from **Gagaruna in Ul'dah - Steps of Lad (x9,y10)** which will unlock Monk job.

  </div>
   <div class="col-md-5">
     The Lightning Gauge indicates a monk's current amount of Greased Lightning as well as the time remaining before the effect fades. Greased Lightning is accumulated by executing certain weaponskills and improves attack speed and damage dealt.

As a monk or pugilist increases in level, the amount of Greased Lightning that can be stored at one time will increase to a maximum of 3 units.
