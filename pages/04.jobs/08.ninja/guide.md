## Play Style

Ninjas are masters of hidding that have access to a variety of Ninjutsus that can be taken advantage of each 20 seconds. Thru the use of particular actions they can deal with enmity in different ways, such as transfering their enmity to other player, and reducing threat generation from a party member.

## How to become a Ninja
The job requires you to have a level 30 [Rogue](http://fellcleave.com/classes/rogue) and the [Sylph-management](http://xivdb.com/quest/66049/sylph-management) main scenario quest completed. The main scenario quest can be accepted from Minfilia in **The Walking Sands (x6,y6)**. Once you have the 2 required steps completed, you can accept [Peasants by Day, Ninjas by Night](http://xivdb.com/quest/65748/peasants+by+day,+ninjas+by+night) from **Jacke in Limsa Lominsa Lower Decks (x8,y16)** quest which will unlock the Ninja job.

   <div class="col-md-5">
      The Ninki Gauge displays the current amount of Ninki a ninja has accumulated. Ninki slowly builds inside a ninja's body with each auto-attack landed and can be used to execute special ninjutsu such as the Hellfrog Medium (acquired at level 62), Bhavacakra (acquired at level 68), and Ten Chi Jin (acquired at level 70).
