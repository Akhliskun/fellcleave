          <p>Far across the rolling waves, towards the rising sun, there lies the island nation of Hingashi.</p>
          <p>In the distant past, the realm's great lords vied for supremacy over its sea-girt confines in a long and bloody conflict. And taking to battle in their lieges' names were noble swordsmen whose art was forged in the crucible of war: the samurai.

## How to become a Samurai
To unlock Samurai you need a **level 50 job** and the Stormblood expansion. Head to Ul'Dah and accept [The way of the Samurai](http://xivdb.com/quest/68095/the+way+of+the+samurai) from Ul'dahn Citizen (x9,y9). Once you complete a short quest chain that will teach you how to use your abilities, Samurai will be unlocked.

   <div class="col-md-5">
     The Sen Gauge displays which of the 3 Sen effects─Setsu (top), Getsu (left), and Ka (right)─are currently accumulated. Sen are required to perform Iaijutsu, the number of Sen accumulated determining which weaponskill will be executed─1 for Higanbana, 2 for Tenka Goken, and 3 for Midare Setsugekka.

      The Kenki Gauge displays the current amount of Kenki a samurai has accumulated. Kenki slowly builds in a samurai's blade through the successful execution of weaponskills. Kenki is required to execute special devastating attacks such as Hissatsu: Kaiten (acquired at level 52), Hissatsu: Gyoten (acquired at level 54), Hissatsu: Guren (acquired at level 70), and more.
