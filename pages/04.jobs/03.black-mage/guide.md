## Lore
<div class="row">

      <blockquote>
          <p>In days long past, there existed an occult and arcane art known as black magicâ€”a potent magic of pure destructive force born forth by a sorceress of unparalleled power. Those who learned to wield this instrument of ruin came to be called black mages, out of both fear and respect for their gift. Yet great power served to corrupt the judgment of mortal man, and so he unknowingly set out upon the path of ruin.</p>
          <p>Adventurers who take the black will become agents of devastation, capable of annihilating those who oppose them through little more than the force of their will.</p>

## Play Style

The **Black Mage** is a ranged DPS job that specializes in destroying their enemies using black magic. Black Mage is an advanced job that requires [Thaumaturge](http://fellcleave.com/classes/thaumaturge).
Known for powerful spells and crowd-control, Black Mage is one, if not, the best job in-game.
<br />

## How to become an Black Mage
The job requires you to have a **level 30 Thaumaturge** and the [Sylph-management](http://xivdb.com/quest/66049/sylph-management) main scenario quest completed. The main scenario quest can be accepted from Minfilia in **The Walking Sands (x6,y6)**. Once you have the 2 required steps completed, you can accept [Taking the Black](http://xivdb.com/quest/66609/taking+the+black) which will unlock Black Mage job.

## Job Gauge

  </div>
   <div class="col-md-5">
      The Elemental Gauge displays several different pieces of information vital to black mages, first and foremost being whether or not they are under the influence of Astral Fire (after casting a Fire spell) or Umbral Ice (after casting a Blizzard spell). All Fire spells cast while under the influence of Astral Fire will have increased potency, but will require more MP. This is the same for Blizzard spells cast while under the influence of Umbral Ice. Umbral Ice also increases the speed with which MP regenerates.

   <div class="col-md-5">
      Executing Enochian while under the influence of either Astral Fire or Umbral Ice will add a bar to the gauge's lower-right corner. Enochian increases the potency of magic attacks, as well as unlocks powerful spells such as Blizzard IV. Enochian fades when Astral Fire or Umbral Ice expires.

   <div class="col-md-5">
      Casting Blizzard IV grants a black mage 3 Umbral Hearts which are represented by the arrows in the gauge's lower-left corner. An Umbral Heart is consumed each time a Fire spell is cast, nullifying the MP cost increase applied by the Astral Fire status

      The Enochian bar will fill every 30 seconds the status is maintained. When the crystal at the bottom of the Elemental Gauge glows pink, the spell Foul (acquired at level 70) can be cast, resetting the timer.
