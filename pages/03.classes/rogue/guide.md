      <blockquote>
          <p>These agile fighters pride themselves on their skills with knives and daggers to make quick work of enemies. Lurking in the shadows, adhering to no laws but their own, they punish the wicked, pilfering their ill-gotten gains and delivering them to the downtrodden masses. Thought by many to be mere common criminals, some would say they play an unseen hand in maintaining order in the buccaneer's haven of Limsa Lominsa.</p>
