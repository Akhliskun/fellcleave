## Guide overview
Welcome to the **Archer Hunting Log guide**, a guide which will help you efficiently find and hunt the monsters required for each hunting log rank.

Below you will be able to find every required monster that you have to hunt, every path that you need to take, the closest Aetheryte and our Tips & Tricks for you to follow. Don't forget to use our comment section below to let us know if any of the information in this guide is wrong or use the right sidebar to navigate to a different log.

## Why should you do hunts
The Class Hunting Logs are one of the main sources of experience when you start working on a new class. Hunts should be your leveling focus up until level 15, which is where you will unlock the first in-game dungeon, [Sastasha](http://xivdb.com/instance/4/sastasha). Experience is nice, but there are a few reasons why you would want to spend some time getting these done even after level 15.

### List of Reasons:
* <font color="white">**Experience**</font>, by far the best option to gain some quick experience at low levels or get that last few percentage that you are missing.
* <font color="white">**Rewards**</font>, Once all ranks 1 to 5 are completed a reward will be waiting for you at [Jonathas](http://xivdb.com/npc/1008145/jonathas) (Old Gridania X 10.6 / Y 6.3). Archerâ€™s reward is [Master Archer's Ring](http://xivdb.com/item/6123/master+archer's+ring) a level 50 ring (iLv55)
* <font color="white">**Achievement Points**</font>, You will receive the [Bump On A Log: Archer](http://xivdb.com/achievement/732/bump+on+a+log:+archer) achievement which rewards 20 points, and unlocks the ring listed above.
* <font color="white">**Minions**</font>, While it's not necessary a class reward, you can also get Minions from doing the Grand Company Hunting Logs, such as [Mammet #003L](http://xivdb.com/item/6167/mammet+#003l) for Maelstrom, [Mammet #003G](http://xivdb.com/item/6168/mammet+#003g) for Order of the Twin Adder and the [Mammet #003U](http://xivdb.com/item/6169/mammet+#003u) for Immortal Flames, each of these will net you an extra 20 achievement points! 
* <font color="white">**Glamours**</font>, Doing the Grand Company Hunts will also unlock Glamours!

**Notes**: You will have to unlock the required Aetherytes before following this guide. Please also keep in mind that without rested bonus experience Rank 1 hunting logs, for example, will not be enough to get you from level 1 to level 10, when possible do a few FATEs or some quests to gain some more experience and/or Grand Company Seals, if you already have a class that is at least Lv20 with Ifrit defeated and the quest done to give you the ability to join any of the 3 GCs.
 
Good luck with your hunts, hero!
