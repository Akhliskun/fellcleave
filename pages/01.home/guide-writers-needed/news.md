If you have answered yes to any or all of these questions then this is your chance to get noticed. 
Fellcleave.com currently has positions available for volunteer translators and **paid guide writers**. 
<hr />

## Guide Writers
**What we would like to see from you**:
* Proven experience on the Class/Job(s) of your choice.
* Be Analytical or a Theorycrafter with a passion. You are the type of person who loves to explain the why behind the how. You can easily tell us why pressing a skill in a certain way will make it be the most effective.

**What we can offer you**:
* Predetermined cash payment for every published guide you write for us! Payment after approval, via PayPal.
* Experienced team to assist you with everything you need when comes to how to write your guide.
* **Networking**. Get feedback and work togheter with some of the top Free Companies and players in FF14.
* **Promotion**. Once accepted as a guide writer, we will add **YOUR** stream to our homepage and give it an awesome rank that will bump you up on the list (when online and streaming) and give you a stream presence that you can’t get any other way!
* Proper credits. Any guide you write, that we publish, will be published under your byline and we will offer links to your Character Profile, FC, Twitter, Twitch or even blog.
* Easy to follow guide templates. All you have to do it fill in the blanks.
* Ability to edit and send the guide for approval as you please and and release. No need to wait for us to update everything, if you choose too and have little HTML knowledge we let you do it yourself! All you need is a GitLab account and you are ready to update your guides! Should you not have the HTML skills, we will do it for you :)
* Permission to moderate your own guide’s comment section. We will keep an eye on it as well, but a fancy “MOD” rank never hurts, does it?

**What we don’t need from you**:
* **Good English**. Don’t be shy if your english is not perfect! Our Chief Editor will take your guide for a spell and grammar check and will make sure your ideas and sentences are easy to follow and understand.
* Any past work experience. Get your first freelancer work with us! If requested we can even give you a recommendation on LinkedIn.

**How to Apply**:
If you are interested in applying for a guide writer spot, we require that you write guide that you can download by clicking on any of the following Job Blueprints: [DPS - Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/119OqUsaZGBPiPoqo6SGp9BFJI-G3nc4kxS3J6LCS5g8/edit?usp=sharing) [DPS - DirectDL](http://fellcleave.com/dps.docx) // [Healing - Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NyStRYfmH2UeKtDdMjHPU9mph9z62zlG6D5XBz8Hb1E/edit?usp=sharing) [Healing - DirectDL](http://fellcleave.com/healing.docx) // [Tanking - Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VhZV5A4Vq8wiDrx9gclg16f3JwadwYQoibrYoTdkzS0/edit?usp=sharing) [Tanking - DirectDL](http://fellcleave.com/tanking.docx) or you can duplicate them inside google drive.

The guide will consist of: <br />
**EndGame Rotation including Best-in-Slot items and Consumables**: 
* This second part will be by far the most important part. Doing well here will get your the position
* Please try to follow all the steps provided in the guide template and make sure your information is accurate.

Again, proper english is not a requirement nor is it going to count against you. **We don’t mind it and we will not decline you for your english**!
