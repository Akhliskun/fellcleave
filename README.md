## What is FellCleave
**FellCleave.com** is a fan site dedicated to providing quality guides for the game FinalFantasy XIV. FellCleave was been build ontop of :heart: [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) :heart: which is an open-source flat-file CMS. Our front end is done in `YAML` templating system and we use `Markdown` syntax as much as possible when working with our content.

## Installation
Because we use MarkDown the installation process only requires you to have any text editor or to have an editor that has MD syntax. We recommend:
* [Remarkable](http://remarkableapp.github.io) `free` for Windows and Linux
* [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com) `free with premium options available` for Mac and iOS

## How to contribute

First make sure you know how MarkDown language works. Here you can read about it [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and here is a cheatsheet [CheatSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
Simply fork the repo then work on a page you wish to make changes to it, read our [CONTRIBUTING page](https://github.com/Akhliskun/fellcleave/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand the process, then do a pull request. After we review your changes, usually will take few hours or up to 2 days, we will bring the changes to the live website and give you credit for the work!
